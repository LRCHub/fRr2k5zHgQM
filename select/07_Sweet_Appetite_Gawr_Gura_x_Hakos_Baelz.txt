Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite
Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite

Fearless, all my makeup is done
Don't worry it's my queendom
Look at me, the face I wanted to see
A makeover indeed
Am I your type? Do you like it?
Ah, darling

Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite
Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite

Come closer, now it's complete
Do you hear my heartbeat?
So far so good
You're setting the mood right
But this is only going to drive me crazy

Are you embarrassed right now?
Or blushing somehow?
But I am guessing it is the same for you and me
Look here, don't blink
And tell me what you think
Well we both know the answer now
Wouldn't you agree?

Fill my appetite
What should I do?
I hope you don't find out
The things I'm shy about
Fill my appetite
What should I do?
My head is still spinning
The verge of exploding
I'm only asking for another chance

Plan B, I'll get closer this time
Next shot better be the bull's eye
New appeal, a sweet and spicy reveal
My looks talk the talk
But now my heart is still naked
Ah, help me

Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite
Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite

I've got the tactics I need
"Patience" is just not for me
No, wait, stop now
God what was I thinking?
'Cause this is only driving me to full on panic!

I'm so embarrassed right now
And blushing somehow
But nothing that I seem to do ever bothers you

I look in your eyes
Just want you to know that
I really, really, really like you

Are you embarrassed right now?
Or blushing somehow?
But I am guessing it is the same for you and me
Look here, don't blink
And tell me what you think
Well we both know the answer now
Wouldn't you agree?

Fill my appetite
What should I do?
I hope you don't find out
The things I'm shy about
Fill my appetite
What should I do?
My head is still spinning
The verge of exploding

Fill my appetite
What should I do?
I hope you don't find out
The things I'm shy about
Fill my appetite
What should I do?
My head is still spinning
The verge of exploding

I'm only asking for another chance
Oh pretty, please I promise one last chance
