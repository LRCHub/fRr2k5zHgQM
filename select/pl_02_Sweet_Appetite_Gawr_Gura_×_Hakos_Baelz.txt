Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite
Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite
Fearless, all my makeup is done
Don't worry it's my queendom
Look at me,
the face I wanted to see
A makeover indeed
Am I your type? Do you like it?
Ah, darling
Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite
Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite
Come closer, now it's complete
Do you hear my heartbeat?
So far so good
You're setting the mood right,
but this is only going
to drive me crazy
Are you embarrassed
right now?
Or blushing somehow?
But I am guessing
it is the same for you and me
Look here, don't blink
And tell me what you think
Well we both know
the answer now,
wouldn't you agree?
Fill my appetite
What should I do…
I hope you don't find out
the things I'm shy about
Fill my appetite
What should I do…
My head is still spinning,
the verge of exploding
I'm only asking
for another chance Uh
Plan B I'll get closer this time
Next shot better
be the bull's eye
New appeal,
a sweet and spicy reveal
My looks talk the talk,
but now my heart is
still naked…Ah, help me
Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite
Uh ra-ta-ta sweet appetite
I've got the tactics I need
""Patience""is just not for me
No, wait, stop now
God what was I thinking?
Cause this is only driving me
to full on panic!
I'm so embarrassed right now
And blushing somehow
But nothing that I seem
to do ever bothers you
I look in your eyes
Just want you to know that
I really really really like you
Are you embarrassed
right now?
Or blushing somehow?
But I am guessing
it is the same for you and me
Look here, don't blink
And tell me what you think
Well we both know
the answer now,
wouldn't you agree?
Fill my appetite
What should I do...
I hope you don't find out
the things I'm shy about
Fill my appetite
What should I do...
My head is still spinning,
the verge of exploding
Fill my appetite
What should I do...
I hope you don't find out
the things I'm shy about
Fill my appetite
What should I do...
My head is still spinning,
the verge of exploding
I'm only asking
for another chance Uh
Oh pretty please I promise one
last chance Uh
